# Polymarket Latency Arbitrage Trading Bot 🤖💰

**Complete automated trading system for Polymarket prediction markets**

## 🎯 What This Does

Automatically detects and trades certainty-based arbitrage opportunities on Polymarket where:
1. Event outcome is 100% certain (game finished, bill passed, etc.)
2. Market hasn't updated yet (latency window)
3. Profit margin > 20% after all costs
4. Fully automated execution with AI validation

**Strategy**: Exploit the time delay between event certainty and market price updates.

## 💰 How to Make Money

### Current Status
- ✅ System monitors real Polymarket markets
- ✅ Detects arbitrage opportunities
- ✅ Validates with AI agents
- ⏳ **Finding opportunities: Need event detection**

### Why No Opportunities Yet?
1. **Only 2 markets currently open** on Polymarket
2. **No event detection** - Can't identify certain outcomes
3. **Need ESPN/Reuters integration** - To know when outcomes are certain

### To Start Making Profit

**Option 1: Add Event Sources (RECOMMENDED)**
Integrate ESPN/Reuters to detect certain outcomes:
```python
# When game finishes:
ESPN: "Lakers win 112-98 - FINAL"
↓
System finds Polymarket market still at $0.65
↓
Buys before market updates to $1.00
↓
Profit!
```

**Option 2: Wait & Monitor**
Keep bot running 24/7:
- Will automatically find opportunities when they appear
- More markets open during major events
- Best during sports seasons, elections, etc.

**Option 3: Fund & Go Live**
1. Add USDC to Polygon wallet
2. Set `PAPER_TRADING=false`
3. System executes real trades when opportunities appear
