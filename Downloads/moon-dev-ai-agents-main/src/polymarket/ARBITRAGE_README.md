# Polymarket Latency Arbitrage System

## Quick Overview

A complete system for detecting and validating certainty-based arbitrage opportunities on Polymarket.

**Status**: ✅ Core system complete and tested

**Strategy**: Exploit latency between event certainty and market price updates

## What This Does

Detects opportunities where:
1. **Event outcome is 100% certain** (game finished, bill passed, rate announced)
2. **Market hasn't updated yet** (price still tradeable at old odds)
3. **Profit margin > 20%** after all costs
4. **Market volume in $10K-$100K range** (sweet spot for execution)
5. **Total costs < $10 per trade** (vig + gas fees)

## Quick Start

### 1. Test Core System

```bash
# Test arbitrage detection
python3 arbitrage_detector.py

# Test agent validation
python3 agent_integration.py

# Run complete demo
python3 examples/demo_arbitrage_system.py
```

### 2. Example Output

```
✓ Opportunity Detected!
  Market: will-team-a-win-game
  Outcome: Yes
  Current Price: $0.650
  Position Size: $1,500.00
  Expected Payout: $2,307.69
  Gross Profit: $807.69
  Vig Cost: $16.15
  Gas Cost: $0.50
  Net Profit: $791.04
  ROI: 52.7%
  Certainty: 100.0%
  Reasoning: Official final score from ESPN Official API
  Latency: 0.00s

✓ Passes all criteria:
  ✓ ROI > 20% (52.7%)
  ✓ Volume $10K-$100K ($50,000)
  ✓ Certainty > 95% (100.0%)
```

## How It Works

### 1. Event Detection
```
Event Source (ESPN API, Reuters, etc)
    ↓
Detect certain outcome (game final, announcement made)
    ↓
Extract: outcome, timestamp, source credibility
```

### 2. Market Matching
```
Query Polymarket API for active markets
    ↓
Filter by volume ($10K-$100K)
    ↓
Match event description to market keywords
    ↓
Map certain outcome to market token
```

### 3. Profit Calculation
```
Position Size: $1,500
Current Price: $0.65 (market hasn't updated)
Certain Price: $1.00 (event is over)

Shares: $1,500 / 0.65 = 2,307.69
Payout: 2,307.69 × $1.00 = $2,307.69
Gross Profit: $2,307.69 - $1,500 = $807.69

Costs:
  Vig (2%): $16.15
  Gas: $0.50
  Total: $16.65

Net Profit: $807.69 - $16.65 = $791.04
ROI: 52.7% ✓
```

### 4. AI Validation
```
Sentiment Agent:
  - Analyzes market sentiment
  - Confirms crowd hasn't caught up
  - Score: 75/100 ✓

Risk Agent:
  - Assesses execution risk
  - Checks liquidity
  - Validates latency window
  - Adjusts position size
  - Score: 35/100 ✓

Final Decision: APPROVED FOR EXECUTION
```

Expected ROI: 47%
```

### 2. Political Arbitrage
```
Event: Infrastructure Bill H.R. 1234 passes Congress
Official Result: 245-190 vote
Source: Congress.gov (credibility: 100%)
Market: "Will H.R. 1234 pass?"
Current Price: $0.72
Action: Buy "Yes" tokens at $0.72, will resolve to $1.00
Expected ROI: 39%
```

### 3. Economic Data Arbitrage

Official Announcement: Federal Reserve Press Release
Source: FederalReserve.gov (credibility: 100%)
Market: "Will Fed raise rates at March meeting?"
Current Price: $0.61 (traders still placing orders)
Action: Buy "Yes" tokens at $0.61, will resolve to $1.00
Expected ROI: 64%
```

## Risk Management

### Position Limits
- Max per trade: $5,000
- Max daily exposure: $50,000
- Max simultaneous positions: 5

### Stop Conditions
- Market closes → abort
- Price moves > 5% → abort
- Latency > 10s → abort
- ROI drops below 20% → abort

### Certainty Requirements
- Sports: game_status = "FINAL" + official source
- News: announcement_made + credibility > 90% + non-reversible
- Economic: official release + no chance of revision

## AI Agent Integration

### Sentiment Agent
Analyzes market sentiment to confirm opportunity exists:
- Score > 50 required
- Checks if crowd has caught up
- Validates latency window still open

### Risk Agent
Assesses trade execution risk:
- Score < 70 required
- Evaluates liquidity
- Checks latency
- Adjusts position size
- Identifies risk factors

## Next Steps for Live Trading

1. **Implement Event Sources**
   - ESPN API for sports
   - Reuters/Bloomberg for news
   - Government APIs for economic data

2. **Set Up Authentication**
   ```bash
   pip install py-clob-client
   export POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY="0x..."
   ```

3. **Start Paper Trading**
   - Simulate orders without executing
   - Validate win rate > 95%
   - Test latency < 5s

4. **Go Live with Small Positions**
   - Start with $100-$500 positions
   - Monitor performance
   - Scale gradually

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Win Rate | > 95% | Only certain outcomes |
| Avg ROI | > 30% | Per successful trade |
| Daily Trades | 1-10 | Quality over quantity |
| Latency | < 5s | Event to execution |
| Cost per Trade | < $2 | Polygon gas is cheap |
| Monthly Profit | $8,000+ | After all costs |

## Troubleshooting

### No opportunities found?
- Markets may not exist in target volume range
- Event keywords may not match market slugs
- Adjust certainty threshold (currently 95%)

### Costs too high?
- Reduce position size (vig is % of profit)
- Wait for better price spread
- Verify gas fees are reasonable

### Agent validation failed?
- Check sentiment score (need > 50)
- Check risk score (need < 70)
- Review risk factors
- May need to adjust position size
