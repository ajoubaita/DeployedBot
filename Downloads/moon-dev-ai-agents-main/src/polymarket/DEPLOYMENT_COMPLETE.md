## 🚨 What to Look For

### Good Signs ✅
- `✓ 499 markets with volume data found` (every 30 seconds)
- `Total HFT targets: 418 markets`
- No errors in stderr log
- Bot status shows "active (running)"

### Warning Signs ⚠️
- Bot status shows "inactive" or "failed"
- Many errors in stderr log
- No new volume history snapshots after hours

### If Bot Stops
```bash
# Check why it stopped
ssh -i ~/.ssh/polymarket_deploy root@159.65.180.152 'journalctl -u polymarket-bot -n 100'

# Restart it
ssh -i ~/.ssh/polymarket_deploy root@159.65.180.152 'systemctl restart polymarket-bot'
```

## 📊 Next Steps

### Tomorrow (Day 1)
- [ ] Check bot is still running
- [ ] Verify logs show market scans
- [ ] Confirm volume history is growing

### End of Week 1 (Day 7)
- [ ] Check baseline completion: should be 35-50%
- [ ] Review any volume anomalies detected
- [ ] Verify 300+ markets ready for detection

### End of Week 2 (Day 14)
- [ ] Check baseline completion: should be 70-100%
- [ ] Review detected volume spikes
- [ ] If 100% complete: Ready for Phase 2!

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Running
```bash
# Check service status
ssh -i ~/.ssh/polymarket_deploy root@159.65.180.152 'systemctl status polymarket-bot'

# View error logs
ssh -i ~/.ssh/polymarket_deploy root@159.65.180.152 'tail -50 /home/polymarket/polymarket/logs/bot_stderr.log'

# Restart service
ssh -i ~/.ssh/polymarket_deploy root@159.65.180.152 'systemctl restart polymarket-bot'
```

### High Memory Usage
```bash
# Check resource usage
ssh -i ~/.ssh/polymarket_deploy root@159.65.180.152 'htop'

# Restart bot (clears memory)
ssh -i ~/.ssh/polymarket_deploy root@159.65.180.152 'systemctl restart polymarket-bot'
```

### Disk Space Full
```bash
# Check disk usage
ssh -i ~/.ssh/polymarket_deploy root@159.65.180.152 'df -h && du -sh /home/polymarket/polymarket/logs/'

# Clean old logs (if needed)
ssh -i ~/.ssh/polymarket_deploy root@159.65.180.152 'find /home/polymarket/polymarket/logs -name "*.log" -mtime +30 -delete'
```

## 🎓 Understanding the Strategy

### What is the bot doing?
1. **Monitoring**: Scanning 499 markets every 30 seconds
2. **Recording**: Saving volume snapshots to build baseline
3. **Detecting**: Looking for 3x+ volume spikes
4. **Calculating**: Signal strength (0-100) when spikes occur
5. **Trading**: Will execute paper trades when signals are strong

### Why no trades yet?
- Need **baseline data** (20 snapshots per market = 1-2 weeks)
- Without baseline, can't detect what's "normal" vs "spike"
- This is Phase 1: **Data Collection Mode**

### When will trades happen?
- After baseline reaches ~50% completion
- When 3x+ volume spikes are detected
- When signal strength > 60/100
- All trades are **PAPER TRADING** (no real money)

## 💰 Cost Estimate

### DigitalOcean Droplet
- 2GB RAM, 70GB Disk: ~$12-18/month
- Data transfer: Minimal (API calls only)
- **Total**: ~$15-20/month for Phase 1

### API Costs
- Polymarket API: **FREE** ✅
- No trading fees in paper mode ✅

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

- ✅ SSH key authentication configured (password disabled recommended)
- ✅ Non-root user created (polymarket)
- ✅ Firewall recommended: `ufw enable && ufw allow 22/tcp`
- ⚠️ Change your DigitalOcean password after deployment
- ⚠️ Never share your SSH private key (~/.ssh/polymarket_deploy)

## 🎉 Congratulations!

Your bot is deployed and running. It will work autonomously for the next 1-2 weeks collecting baseline data.

**Check back daily** to monitor progress. Once baseline reaches 100%, you'll be ready for Phase 2 optimizations!

**Questions?**
- Check the logs first: `/home/polymarket/polymarket/logs/`
- Review DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md for detailed troubleshooting
- Check PHASE1_QUICK_START.md for quick reference

**Remember**: This is **paper trading mode**. No real money is at risk. The bot is learning and collecting data! 🚀
