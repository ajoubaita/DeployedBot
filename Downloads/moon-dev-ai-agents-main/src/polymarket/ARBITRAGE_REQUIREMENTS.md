# Polymarket Latency Arbitrage Requirements

## Core Strategy: Certainty-Based Latency Play

This is NOT speculation - we're betting on events where the outcome is already known but the market hasn't updated yet.

### Example Scenarios
1. **Sports scores**: Game ends, official result announced, but Polymarket market still open for 30-60 seconds
2. **News announcements**: Government announcement made, but takes time for users to see and trade
3. **Election results**: Official results published, market hasn't closed yet
4. **Economic data releases**: Fed rate decision announced at 2pm, market still tradeable

## Financial Constraints

### Trading Costs
- **API Fees**: $0 (public read-only endpoints)
- **Polymarket Vig**: ~2% (needs confirmation - appears to be on net winnings)
- **Gas Fees**: Polygon network (~$0.01-0.10 per trade)
- **Total Cost per Trade**: < $10 (target: $0.10-$2)

### Profit Requirements
- **Minimum Margin**: 20% post-vig
- **Market Volume**: $10K - $100K
- **Position Size**: Dynamic based on certainty and volume

### Example Trade Math
```
Market: "Will Team A win?" (Game already ended, Team A won)
Current Price: $0.60 (should be $1.00)
Position Size: $1,000
Expected Payout: $1,666.67 ($1,000 / 0.60)
Gross Profit: $666.67
Vig (2% on profit): $13.33
Net Profit: $653.33
ROI: 65.3% ✓ (exceeds 20% requirement)
Cost per trade: $0.50 (gas) ✓ (under $10)
```

## Technical Requirements

### Latency Requirements
- **Event Detection**: < 1 second from news source
- **Market Data Fetch**: < 500ms (WebSocket)
- **Decision Making**: < 100ms (agent analysis)
- **Order Placement**: < 2 seconds
- **Total**: < 4 seconds from event to trade execution

### Event Sources (in order of priority)
1. **Official Sources**: ESPN API, government websites, Fed announcements
2. **WebSocket Feeds**: Real-time sports scores, news wires
3. **Social Media**: Twitter/X official accounts (verified only)
4. **Market Data**: Polymarket own WebSocket for price changes

### Market Filtering
```python
def is_valid_opportunity(market):
    return (
        10_000 <= market['volume'] <= 100_000 and
        market['accepting_orders'] and
        not market['closed'] and
        event_outcome_is_certain() and  # Key check
        expected_roi_post_vig() > 0.20
    )
```

## Certainty Detection

### What Qualifies as "Certain"?
1. **Official announcement made** (government, sports league, company)
2. **Multiple credible sources confirm** (3+ major outlets)
3. **No possibility of reversal** (not subject to review/appeal)
4. **Market hasn't updated** (still tradeable at old price)

### What Does NOT Qualify?
- Rumors or speculation
- Single-source reports
- Events that could be reversed
- "Likely" outcomes (even 99% probability)
- Analysis or predictions

## System Architecture

### Components
1. **Event Monitor** (new): Watches official sources for announcements
2. **Market Matcher** (new): Maps events to Polymarket markets
3. **Certainty Validator** (new): Confirms outcome is certain
4. **Profit Calculator** (new): Calculates post-vig ROI
5. **Trade Executor** (needs auth): Places orders via CLOB API
6. **Risk Manager**: Position sizing and exposure limits

### Agent Integration
Use existing agents for:
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Confirm market hasn't moved (still opportunity)
- **Risk Assessment**: Validate trade size and exposure
- **News Validation**: Cross-reference multiple sources

## Risk Management

### Position Limits
- Max per trade: $5,000
- Max daily exposure: $50,000
- Max markets simultaneously: 5

### Stop Conditions
- Market closes before execution → abort
- Price moves against us > 5% → abort
- Execution time > 10 seconds → abort
- ROI drops below 20% → abort

## Compliance & Ethics

### Important Notes
1. This is legal arbitrage, not market manipulation
2. We're using publicly available information
3. No insider trading - only public announcements
4. No automated market making (read-only on public endpoints)

### Ethical Boundaries
- Only trade on outcomes that are factually determined
- Don't exploit technical glitches
- Don't manipulate markets
- Follow Polymarket terms of service

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Research & Validation (Current)
- [ ] Confirm exact vig/fee structure
- [ ] Test WebSocket latency
- [ ] Identify high-frequency event types
- [ ] Calculate realistic profit margins

### Phase 2: Event Detection System
- [ ] Build event monitors for key sources
- [ ] Create market-event mapping database
- [ ] Implement certainty validation logic
- [ ] Test latency end-to-end

### Phase 3: Trading Integration
- [ ] Set up authenticated CLOB client (py-clob-client)
- [ ] Implement order placement logic
- [ ] Add position tracking
- [ ] Build profit/loss reporting

### Phase 4: Production
- [ ] Paper trading (simulated orders)
- [ ] Small position testing ($100-$500)
- [ ] Scale to target size
- [ ] Continuous monitoring and optimization

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **Win Rate**: > 95% (only certain outcomes)
- **Average ROI**: > 30% per trade
- **Daily Trades**: 1-10 (quality over quantity)
- **Latency**: < 5 seconds event-to-execution
- **Cost Efficiency**: < $2 per trade

### Monthly Goals
- **Gross Profit**: $10,000+
- **Net Profit**: $8,000+ (after all costs)
- **Sharpe Ratio**: > 3.0
- **Max Drawdown**: < 5%
